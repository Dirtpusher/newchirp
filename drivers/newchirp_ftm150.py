"""Yaesu FTM-150R/E/ASP experimental driver.

The official ADMS-17 v1.0.1 default image is 98304 bytes with model
identifier AH086. Its channel records and surrounding layout are compatible
with the CHIRP FTM-300DR AH071 driver. NewChirp initially exposes memory
channels only; untested APRS, GPS, and digital settings remain hidden.
